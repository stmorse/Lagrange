<p>My current research interests are in complex systems, machine learning, and optimization.  Specifically, I am doing work on information spread through social networks, human mobility, and competitive influence maximization.  I am affiliated with <a href="http://www.draper.com">Draper Laboratory</a> and <a href="http://humnetlab.mit.edu">HuMNet Lab</a>.</p>

    <h4><i>Information spread</i></h4>
    <p>A challenge in large-scale passive-collection communication datasets is inferring the true information spreading structure, or latent network.   We know A called B, but not why, or whether this influences B to call C.  One method to extract meaningful structure is to look for recurring patterns: imagine if we see A call B and C, who call D and E, and then the same pattern (or something very similar) occurs again every week or two over the course of several months.  Using methods of inexact tree matching and hierarchical clustering, we define, find, and analyze these group conversations (termed "persistent cascades") and show they reveal new roles in network topology and spreading dynamics.<br>

    </p> 
    <p>Another approach is to define a probabilistic model of the network interaction structure and learn its parameters.  We can model communication events as arrivals in a stochastic process that is dependent on its immediate history (e.g. A calls B increases the probability B calls A back) and other processes (e.g. A to B increases the probability of B to C); in particular the <i>Hawkes process</i>.  In <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/6867-project.pdf">this project</a> we explore the predictive power of univariate Hawkes processes applied to the persistent cascades from above, learning the parameters with a regularized MAP EM scheme.  Current work is to extend this model to the multivariate case, with a process on each edge in the network.

    <h4><i>Influence through mobility</i></h4>
    <p>Suppose, for some user A, we observe several of A's friends changing their mobility patterns (i.e. places they frequent) over time to be more like A.  We might then infer that A is influencing the behavior of his friends over time.  Using geo-tagged data (like mobile phone records), we seek to identify and quantify these changes and the central users. This gives a behavioral influence measure of centrality, in contrast to the standard graph topology measures like degree, betweenness, etc.</p>

    <h4><i>Competitive influence maximization</i></h4>
    <p>Most models of information or opinion spread focus on long-term consensus at the expense of short-term accuracy.  We investigate a model that captures peer influence and agent-specific influence abilities, allowing persistent pockets of opinion and slower spread.  Current work is to analyze this model under a competitive influence maximization scheme.</p>

    <h4><i>Trace diagrams</i></h4>
    <p>My undergraduate work was with so-called <i>trace diagrams</i> (also <i>birdtracks</i>, <i>spin networks</i>, and other names), which are structured graphs representing multilinear functions.  They are essentially a notational invention which provide a simple, graphical, intuitive way of performing otherwise complicated tensor or matrix calculations.  Versions of this notation show up in physics, and the current incarnation has gained some traction (<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.0316.pdf">normal factor</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.3833.pdf">graphs</a>, generalization to commutative <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1596553">monads</a>), but it is still a niche area of research.  The paper below defines them in a rigorous way and shows the power of the notation with several extremely short proofs of classic results in linear algebra.</p>
