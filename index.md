I'm a second-year Masters student in the [Operations Research Center](http://orc.mit.edu) at MIT.  Following this program, I will serve as an Instructor at the [U.S. Military Academy](http://www.usma.edu) (West Point) for 3 years teaching undergraduate math.  I am currently doing research with MIT's [HuMNet Lab](http://humnet.mit.edu) and the [Draper Laboratory](http://www.draper.com) in complex networks, in particular the spread of information and influence through a social network.  This research is a nice mix of complex networks, machine learning, optimization, large-scale data science, and I really enjoy it.</p>
    
I am also an active-duty military officer.  I commissioned in 2008 from West Point, and have served in Afghanistan as a rifle platoon leader, and Kuwait as an infantry company commander.  I've also held various staff positions at the Company, Brigade, and Division level.  After completing my tour as a West Point instructor, I plan to return to the operational Army and running around in the woods with guns.

I'm passionate about guitar, piano, hiking, traveling, languages, chess, hunting, reading, and good bourbon.  My backup career plan is to professionally busk.  I recently co-authored a neural network with my wife; we named him Isaac and he loves blueberries.
